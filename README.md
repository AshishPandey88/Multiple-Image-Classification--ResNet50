# Multiple-Image-Classification--ResNet50
ResNet-50 is a convolutional neural network that is 50 layers deep. 

"You can load a pretrained version of the network trained on more than a million images from the ImageNet database. The pretrained network can classify images into 1000 object categories, such as keyboard, mouse, pencil, and many animals. As a result, the network has learned rich feature representations for a wide range of images. The network has an image input size of 224-by-224"- Source: Mathworks
